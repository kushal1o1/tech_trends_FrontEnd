# TechTrendFrontend

TechTrendFrontend is a React-based web application that displays the latest tech trends, categorized into Nepali and Global sectors. The data is fetched from a Django RESTful API (`TechTrendAPI`) but uses static data for the live deployment due to hosting constraints. 

## Features

- **React-Based UI**: A dynamic and responsive user interface built with React.
- **Category Filtering**: View tech trends categorized into Nepali and Global.
- **Static Data**: The deployment uses static data instead of real-time data fetching due to hosting limitations.
- **Simple and Clean Design**: Focusing on clarity and ease of use.
